# PMVDesk
Virtual Desktop application for OS/2, year 1994

It has been a while since I used OS/2 and even longer since I wrote any OS/2 code...
PMVDesk was something I wrote as for my C-studies at the university in early 1990. However it was quite fun, so I did do a little more than needed to get my C-course accepted ;-)

I did develop a "Pro" version including a visual virtual desktop with small windows. However it newer passed my quality checks and I newer released it.
I also developed "the best" screen capture application for OS/2 called PMSnap. It not only captured the visible desktop, it also did capture all virtual desktops and made a huge screen capture as one big picture with the whole visible and virtual deskops. My friend, Peter Nielsen (PMView), helped me with the graphics part of the PMSnap code.
